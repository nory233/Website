        <h1>Education</h1>
        <p>
            Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering
Technical University of Sofia
Graduated with Distinction,

During my studies at the Technical University of Sofia, I developed a strong foundation in computer science principles, software development, and engineering practices. My coursework included programming languages, algorithms, data structures, and systems design, which equipped me with the technical skills needed to excel in the field.

For my thesis, I designed and developed an augmented reality (AR) application that allows users to visualize furniture in their own spaces before making a purchase.
This project involved utilizing Unity and AR Foundation, along with Azure for cloud-based asset management, emphasizing user experience and design principles. 
This experience ignited my passion for UI/UX design and its potential to enhance the way users interact with technology.

        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
            I am Noor Salama, a dedicated and innovative computer engineer with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the Technical University of Sofia, where I graduated with distinction. My academic journey not only equipped me with a solid technical foundation but also ignited my passion for design and user experience.

            For my thesis, I developed an augmented reality (AR) application that allows users to visualize furniture in their own environments before making a purchase decision. Using Unity and AR Foundation, along with Azure for cloud-based asset management, I created a tool that enhances the shopping experience by bridging the gap between digital and physical spaces.
            This project honed my skills in both programming and user-centered design,
            leading me to discover my enthusiasm for creating intuitive interfaces and engaging experiences.
            In addition to my technical skills, I thrive on collaboration and creativity. I enjoy working on diverse projects that challenge me to think critically and push the boundaries of technology. I am particularly interested in leveraging my knowledge in UI/UX design to create solutions that not only meet user needs but also have a positive impact on society. I believe that technology should empower users and improve their everyday lives, and I am excited to contribute to projects that reflect this ethos.
